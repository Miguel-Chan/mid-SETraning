1. The jumper will move to the cell in front of it in the current step. Then jump over the flower or rock in the next step.

2. The jumper will move to the cell in front of it in the current step. Then turn in the next step.

3. It will turn.

4. The jumper will move to the cell in front of it in the current step. Then for the next step if the cell two cells in front of its current location is available then it will jump to that cell.

5. One will move 2 cells ahead and the other one cell ahead.

6. If a jumper has an actor(not a flower or a rock) in front will it jump over? 

   In my design it will jump over just like facing a flower or a rock.
